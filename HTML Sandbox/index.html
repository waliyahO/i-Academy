    <p>Critically evaluate the extent to which understanding followers is as important as understanding leaders in contemporary organisations</p>
    <h2> <u>He who cannot be a good follower, cannot be a good leader</u> </h2>
    <p>There is no leader without at least one follower—that’s obvious. Yet the modern leadership industry, is  <span>built on the proposition</span>  that leaders matter a great deal and followers hardly at all. Good leadership is the stuff of countless courses, workshops, books, and articles. Everyone wants to makes leaders tick—the charismatic ones, the retiring ones, and even the crooked ones.</p>
    <h3> <em>Followership</em> </h3>
    <p>Good follower stuff of nearly nothing. Most of the limited research and writing on subordinates has tended to either the context of leaders’ development rather than followers’ or mistakenly assume that followers are amosame.</p>
    <h4> <i>Leadership</i> </h4>
    <p>Our concept about leadership is that it is primarily an influencing role. This means that in a position of <s>authority</s> , an individual influences others and is influenced by the actions and the attitudes of followers.</p>
    <h5>The relationship between the two</h5>
    <p>Both positions are equally important, require responsibility, and interact with each other: the leader must help his followers grow, whereas the followers must contribute to the success of their leader</p>
    <h6>Why Understanding <mark>Followership Is Important</mark> Followership Is Important</h6>
    <p>In addition to <b>possessing initiative, independence, commitment</b> to common goals, and courage, a follower can provide enthusiastic support of a leader, but not to the extent that a follower fails to challenge a leader who is unethical or threatens the values or <blockquote>Followership Is Important</blockquote> objectives of the organization. We believe that ineffective followers are as much to blame for poor performance, ethical and legal lapses within organizations as are poor and unethical leaders. Followers have a responsibility to speak up when leaders do things wrong. </p>
